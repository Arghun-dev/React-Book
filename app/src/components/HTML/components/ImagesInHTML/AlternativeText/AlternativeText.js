import './AlternativeText.scss';

const AlternativeText = () => {
  return (
    <div className='alternativeTextRoot'>
      <h2>Alternative Text</h2>
      <p>
        The next attribute we&#39;ll look at is alt. Its value is supposed to be a
        textual description of the image, for use in situations where the image
        cannot be seen/displayed or takes a long time to render because of a slow
        internet connection. For example, our above code could be modified like so:
      </p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AlternativeText;
